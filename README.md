LAMP Ansible Drupal6 Git Vagrant

A Drupal development platform in a box, with everything you would need to develop Drupal 6 websites. This was created by the Support department at Inclind to maintain existing Drupal 6 sites. When in rome.. right? Nevermind.

GLAD6 supports the following technologies in addition to Vlad:

* Git > 2.0
